# BankApplication

This is a simple banking system built with Angular 16 and Node 18. The application allows users to perform basic banking operations such as transfers, deposits, and balance and statement inquiries. 

To get started, clone the project and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. Then, start the development server by running `npm run start` and `npm run start:mock` in separate terminals concurrently if you don't want to run the api. In case you are already running the api, `npm run start`.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` and `npm run start:mock` in separate terminals concurrently. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests.
